# Control-M XML Automation Utilities

     This repository contains Python scripts designed to automate complex modifications and standardizations of Control-M job definition XML files. These tasks often involve preparing definitions for deployment across different environments (Dev, Preprod, Prod) and ensuring adherence to configuration standards.

     Scripts handle tasks such as:
     * Updating environment-specific parameters (servers, users, names).
     * Standardizing quantitative resource allocation.
     * Normalizing failure notification settings.
     * Activating job folders.

     These scripts are adapted from real-world automation tasks, using a comprehensive, anonymized sample XML file.
